## Intro

This is not a simple upload to s3 lambda function. It could be just done with a simple fetch getting the url from event.body but since the task mentioned to show my coding style, i went ahead and created an entire express rest api.

## How to run

The only thing to do would be to update the bucket name in the serverless.yml file.
